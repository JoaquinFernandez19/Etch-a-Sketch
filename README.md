## Made from scratch all by myself
Some of my projects follow a line from people that know best. But this one is pure, a rare specimen, all by myself.

### There is a chance that i add more features in the future.
If a have some free time i will add:
-color picker for all colors
-rainbow mode
-posibility to change the background

And, in time, when i know a lot of things, make a version imitating the Paint from windows
